# WaterTimer💧

📱 An Android application that will remind you every 45 minutes to drink water

⬇️ As I didn't pay the $25 to upload the app on the Play Store, you can download this app by clicking on the link below:

⚠️ I also made a version where the timer was set to only 10 seconds if you intend to test the app. You can download this version by clicking on the link below:

👨🏼‍💻 To make this app, I used React Native and Expo. It was my first experience developing software for mobile and using Expo as well

🎯 As I intended from the beginning, the app is simple and is to help me stay hydrated. However, if it helps you, I will be pleased😁
