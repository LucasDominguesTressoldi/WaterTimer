# WaterTimer💧

📱 An Android application that will remind you, every 45 minutes, to drink water

⬇️ As I didn't pay the $25 to upload the app on the Play Store, you can download this app by clicking on the link below:

⚠️ You will need to convert .aab to .apk, I suggest the AAB to APK Converter Installer to do that (link below):

👨🏼‍💻 To make this app I used React Native and Expo. It was my first experience developing software for mobile and using Expo as well

🎯 As I intended from the beginning, the app is simple and is to help me stay hydrated. However, if it helps you, I will be very happy too😁
